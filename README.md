Installation and operating instructions
---------------------------------------

There are two ways download the RF-MAP files:

1.  From the Linux command line, type
    `git clone https://github.com/dkahle/rf-map.git`; the directory will
    appear in the directory given by typing `pwd` at the command line.
2.  From within RStudio, go to File &gt; New Projectâ€¦ &gt; Version
    Control &gt; Git, then type in
    `https://github.com/dkahle/rf-map.git` as the repository, and Create
    Project.

The GitHub repository has three main files:

-   `busi.csv`, which contains data sued for generating the RF-MAP
    model,
-   `input.csv`, which is a template file for entering new data, and
-   `rf-map.R`, the R file that generates the RF-MAP model.
