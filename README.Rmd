# rf-map


## Installation and operating instructions

There are two ways download the RF-MAP files:

1.  From the Linux command line, type `git clone https://github.com/dkahle/rf-map.git`; the directory will appear in the directory given by typing `pwd` at the command line.
2.  From within RStudio, go to File > New Project... > Version Control > Git, then type in `https://github.com/dkahle/rf-map.git` as the repository, and Create Project.

The GitHub repository has three main files: 

* `busi.csv`, which contains data sued for generating the RF-MAP model,
* `input.csv`, which is a template file for entering new data, and
* `rf-map.R`, the R file that generates the RF-MAP model.
